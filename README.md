# VMS

VMS stand for Versatile Measuring Station. The aim of the projet is to build an Android app capable of using every sensor of an android device for measuring purpose.

#Introduction
At the beggining of the project we needed to master the sqlite implementation of android, know its perf. So we benshmarked it using simple objects to test the different way of requesting de DB and inserting data.
This work can be found in the "?????" branch of this repo.
In the same time we work with sensors to understand them et learn how to use them.

#Development
After the benchmark part we leave it and really started to develop for the project. We build the project around the sensor part adding the DB CRUD beside. When the sensors we working alone we added the recording of the measures.

#Conclusion
We used lot of onlines ressources.
